What is your favorite movie?
Kill Bill
If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
New Zealand
If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
Curative voice. Because I could fulfill my childhood dream of becoming an 
international popstar AND help people AND get mega-rich because I'd pull a 
Taylor Swift and not allow my albums on Spotify.
